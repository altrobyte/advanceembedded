Assignment 1: Custom Blink Pattern (Intermediate)
Objective: Create your own industrial alert pattern

Requirements:

Design a unique blink pattern using 1 LED

Must have 3 different speeds (slow, medium, fast)

Each speed runs for 5 blinks

Add descriptive logs for each blink

Total cycle time should be under 30 seconds

Example Pattern:

Slow: 1000ms (5 blinks)

Medium: 500ms (5 blinks)

Fast: 200ms (5 blinks)

Deliverable: Code + explanation of what industrial condition this pattern represents

Assignment 2: SOS Emergency Signal (Intermediate)
Objective: Implement Morse code SOS pattern

Requirements:

LED on GPIO 2

SOS pattern: 3 short, 3 long, 3 short

Short blink: 200ms ON, 200ms OFF

Long blink: 600ms ON, 200ms OFF

Gap between S-O-S: 500ms

Loop continuously

Log "S", "O", "S" messages
